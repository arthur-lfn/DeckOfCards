### About

This project showcases a deck of cards and two custom animations created with SwiftUI.
The user can swipe left or right to navigate through the cards or swipe up to remove a card from the deck.

These animations served as a starting point for Spatial Cards, an educational game currently available on TestFlight and soon on the App Store.
